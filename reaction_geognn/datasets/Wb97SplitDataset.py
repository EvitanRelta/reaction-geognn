    """Dataset class for loading a SINGLE wB97X-D3 fold-split CSV file.

    Computational activation energies (but lacking the enthalpy values found in
    the original wB97X-D3 dataset) of forward and reversed reaction at the
    Ï‰B97X-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory.

    Data/Labels are `tensor([activation_energy])`.

    The fold-split is as defined in the paper -
    `"Machine Learning of Reaction Properties via Learned Representations of the Condensed Graph of Reaction"`.

    Split CSV files are downloadable at: \\
    https://github.com/hesther/reactiondatabase/tree/main/data_splits

    Which were split and used by: \\
